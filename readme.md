## FAQ

#### Why when there are already Python SDKs for Alpaca?

I primarily write code on mobile, crazy I know however, that being the case I cant install most packages with C-Dependancies which led me here.

#### Why on Earth would you write code on mobile?

Im a man of many hats, I work a full-time job, I'm a husband, a Father and somewhat of a gamer. My time to sit at a desk or with a laptop is limited these days.
