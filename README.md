# Trade-Alchemy
A python project built from scratch to interact with the Alpaca API

This is a highly specialized project built specifically to bring alpaca api capability to the Pythonista app on ios. 

As a side note, I am aware someone has probably already done this, I want to build out the project myself for educational purposes

Roadmap:
    1-1 pairing with ALL alpaca API methods
    custom buildouts for routines I use frequently such as:
        1. Automatic portflio rebalancing
        2. Dollar Cost Averaging
        3. Scaling in and out of trades without tripping PDT rules
        4. Algorythmic trading bots
        5. Built in plotting mechanisms 
        6. Custom portfolio reports
        7. Dividend tracking, reinvensting and projection
    Custom in app UI using a great tool for Pythonista called Flixy
